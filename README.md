# Introduction
## Motivation :
Sentiment Analysis, is receiving a big attention these days, because of its huge specrum of applications ranging from product review analysis, compain feedback, competition benchmarking, customer profiles, political trends, etc...

There is a huge flow of information coming from the internet and social networks. Online discussions are only relevant to people for a couple of days. Nobody actulaly goes in past tweets for more than a week, for instance. This entire humanity archive of discussion could help in many applications if we train machines to understand the sentiment of people towards a specific theme at a specific time. 

## Background
“Sentiment analysis is the computational study of people's opinions, sentiments, emotions, and attitudes.” [Excerpt From: Bing Liu. Sentiment Analysis: Mining Opinions, Sentiments, and Emotions.] 

Given the large amount of data available on the Web, it is now possible to investigate high-level Information Retrieval tasks like user's intentions and feelings about facts or objects discussed. [Pang, B., Lee, L., 2008. Opinion mining and sentiment analysis. Foundations and Trends in Information Retrieval]

## Challenge :
There are several things to take into consideration when approaching a Sentiment Analysis task. In general, there are two main approaches: 

- Sentiment lexicons using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. A Sentiment lexicon is a list of words that are associated to polarity values (positive or negative). NLP techniques offer a deep level of analysis since they take into account the context words in the sentence. 


- Machine Learning classification algorithms. Because sentiment classification is a text classification problem, any existing supervised learning method can be directly applied [Bing Liu]. For example,  naïve Bayes classification , logistic regression, support vector machines (SVM), etc..
